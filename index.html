			<h3>My Learning Style</h3>
			<p><strong>Visual</strong></p>
			<p>30% Auditory</p>
			<p>40% Visual</p>
			<p>30% Tactile</p>-->
			<h3>Quantitative/Qualitative Activity</h3>
			<p>3 Quantitative Accomplishments:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>I have earned 3 college level degrees and 2 certificates (so far)</li>
				<li>As a paralegal, I assisted attorneys with successful billion dollar patent portfolio deals</li>
				<li>I've seen my favorite band live 17 times (so far)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>3 Qualitative features about myself:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>I am very detail oriented, which means I can locate and fix mistakes (small and large). This can also mean I spend quite a bit of time troubleshooting.</li>
				<li>I am very organized, which means I know where to find information when it is needed. However, it is possible others may not understand my organizational structure, and may not be able to find the information if I am not around.</li>
				<li>I am deadline driven, which is important for clients, who will receive work on time. In some situations, this could mean that I have to cut corners to meet tight deadlines.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Passion Project Activity: How do I balance the creative and logical sides of my brain?</h3>
			<p>I am very passionate about travel and music, and love to plan trips to see live music with my husband. I love the logic and definitiveness of travel planning, as I get to research and find the best hotels, transportation and activities for that particular trip. I also love that I get to use creativity to create new options that may not have been initially visible at the start of the planning process, with the ultimate goal of creating a fun, organized, but not overly planned trip. A good example of this was a trip we planned in 2017 to go to a music festival in England. The logical challenges involved planning a trip for 5 people of various ages and various travel backgrounds, with different goals, at the height of summer when activity and hotel prices were very high. We used a lot of creativity to plan ways for everyone to have a variety of experiences (by breaking up into separate groups at times), and to find solutions when things didn't go as planned (i.e., suddenly finding ourselves with no accommodations). But when we were able to use logic and creativity together, we were able to succeed with planning a great trip where everyone had great experiences.</p>

		<h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>
			<p><strong>Version 1</strong></p>
			<p>Hi, I'm Erica Tollefson. I am a freelance developer who builds websites for creatives and solopreneurs, aiming to make their lives easier by tailoring their sites to their customers' needs. Does your website need a refresh?</p>

		<h3>Visual Speaks</h3>
			<img src="Visuals-Speak-Activity.jpg" height="300" width="450" alt="Pictures of visual speaks activity">
			<p>The image on the left showcases where I am currently in my career journey. I am ready to embark on a new phase by heading into the harbor, but am still completing preparations for the journey, and the water I will be launching into is within sight.</p>
			<p>The image on the right showcases where I would like to be in a few years time: well into my journey, with a possible destination on the horizon, working hard to continue to build skills that will take me closer to my destination.</p>
			<p>I hope to bridge these two images by gathering the skills, information and supports I need to start my own business. I believe it's important for everyone to continue to learn and grown throughout their lifetimes, so I will also continue to focus on gaining new skills, and trying to keep up to date with changes in the field, as technology constantly evolves.</p>
		<h3>Online Identity Chart</h3>
			<img src="online-identity-chart.jpg" height="341" width="578" alt="Chart of online identities">
			<p>While searching for myself online, I primarily found my LinkedIn page (which is/will be full of professional and academic information), a web design and photography portfolio, and information about other people with the same name. I don't have any publicly available social media profiles. Fortunately, the information showing about other people with the same name is very benign (in case someone thought any of that information was about me). There does not appear to be anything that would keep a human resources employee from calling me in for an interview, though it might also help to increase my online visibility and branding.</p>

	<h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>
		<h3>Week 0</h3>
			<h4>Concept Map</h4>
			<p><img src="concept-map.jpg" alt="concept map diagram" height="356" width="641"></p>
			<br>
		<h3>Week 1</h3>
			<p>The first week of bootcamp has been very interesting and challenging. I love learning, and I love being challenged, so I feel like I am in the right place, as I need to work hard to keep up with the new concepts and information we are getting everyday, which on the whole feels like a good challenge. I am just hoping the coming weeks won't feel too overwhelming as we have a lot of information to cover in a short time...</p>
		<h3>Week 2</h3>
			<p>This week has been a little bit of a roller coaster at bootcamp. As we worked through the first phase of our object oriented assignment, I realized how much terminology there is to learn while learning new aspects of technology (the assignment felt like a foreign language at first). Hopefully the terminology will come while just generally learning how to put concepts into practice, but it is another area I realize I need to focus on.</p>
		<h3>Week 3</h3>
		<	p>This week we played the game Forbidden Island as a team building activity with our newly-assigned capstone project teams. None of us had played the game before, so we spent some time initially learning how to setup the game and trying to figure out the gameplay. I felt like the three of us worked really well together to handle the challenges of the game. I thought it was interesting that the game gives each player a card showing their strengths that the team can rely on as needed throughout the game. This was a really good reminder that while working on our capstone together, we'll need to rely on each other's strengths, as well. I also noticed during the game that we all were good about voicing our thoughts on what the next steps should be, and I realized I need to make certain I am also listening to everyone else, and not being too pushy with my ideas (normally this isn't an issue for me, but apparently this is something I need to be aware of in heightened, time-limited situations). This was definitely a good learning experience, and gave me some things to think about in regards to working as part of a team.</p>
		<h3>Week 4</h3>
			<p>This week has been challenging in regards to keeping up with all of the activities required for bootcamp, from exercises about CSS and Bootstrap, to ProDev, to our personal and group projects. There is so much value in each of these activities, but it can be a lot to keep balanced! I'm generally very good with time management, but it's still challenging when there is so much to do, and just not enough existing time to get it done...</p>
