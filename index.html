			<h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>
			<h3>Week 1</h3>
			<br>
			<h4>Concept Map</h4>
			<p><img src="concept-map.jpg" alt="concept map diagram" height="356" width="641"></p>
			<h4>Quantitative/Qualitative Activity</h4>
			<p>3 Quantitative Accomplishments:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>I have earned 3 college level degrees and 2 certificates (so far)</li>
				<li>As a paralegal, I assisted attorneys with successful billion dollar patent portfolio deals</li>
				<li>I've seen my favorite band live 17 times (so far)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>3 Qualitative features about myself:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>I am very detail oriented, which means I can locate and fix mistakes (small and large). This can also mean I spend quite a bit of time troubleshooting.</li>
				<li>I am very organized, which means I know where to find information when it is needed. However, it is possible others may not understand my organizational structure, and may not be able to find the information if I am not around.</li>
				<li>I am deadline driven, which is important for clients, who will receive work on time. In some situations, this could mean that I have to cut corners to meet tight deadlines.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Passion Project Activity: How do I balance the creative and logical sides of my brain?</h4>
			<p>I am very passionate about travel and music, and love to plan trips to see live music with my husband. I love the logic and definitiveness of travel planning, as I get to research and find the best hotels, transportation and activities for that particular trip. I also love that I get to use creativity to create new options that may not have been initially visible at the start of the planning process, with the ultimate goal of creating a fun, organized, but not overly planned trip. A good example of this was a trip we planned in 2017 to go to a music festival in England. The logical challenges involved planning a trip for 5 people of various ages and various travel backgrounds, with different goals, at the height of summer when activity and hotel prices were very high. We used a lot of creativity to plan ways for everyone to have a variety of experiences (by breaking up into separate groups at times), and to find solutions when things didn't go as planned (i.e., suddenly finding ourselves with no accommodations). But when we were able to use logic and creativity together, we were able to succeed with planning a great trip where everyone had great experiences.</p>
